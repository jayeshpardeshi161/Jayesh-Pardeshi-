# Jayesh-Pardeshi- Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio

# ðŸ“Š Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio

Hi, I'm a former 3D Animation professional with 16+ years of experience in global studios like DreamWorks, Disney, and Universal Pictures. Now transitioning into the world of Data Analytics and Data Science, I've built a portfolio of real-world, self-initiated projects using tools like Power BI, Tableau, SQL, Python, and Machine Learning.

This repository contains a collection of my end-to-end projects that reflect my hands-on learning, creativity, and problem-solving approach using data.
